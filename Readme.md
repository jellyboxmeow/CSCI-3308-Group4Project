## Brief Application Description
The goal of our application is to allow trading card collectors to be able to find the value of their cards by searching it up in our application and getting its value. The users will be able to login, save their cards into a collection and trade cards with other users on the platform.

It will not be limited to just one set of trading card games, including many such as Pokemon, Magic: The Gathering, etc. Therefore collectors of all TCGs will be able to participate and trade through the website.
